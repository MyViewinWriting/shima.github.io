My research and professional interests revolve around understanding businesses, analyzing their data, and applying machine learning techniques to extract actionable insights. I hold a Master Degree in International Management from [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/), Moscow & [EDHEC Business School](https://www.edhec.edu/en) (Exchange sem-duration)

Professional Experience
======
üìöI have research experience as a Research Analyst at [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/), where I contributed to crowdsourcing contests, analyzing the socio-economic profiles of participants. I have presented this work at Open and User Innovation Conference [OUI](https://sites.google.com/view/oui2019/homepage). This experience strengthened my understanding of data analysis 
and sparked my passion for uncovering patterns in complex datasets.

üíªIn addition to research, I have hands-on experience in business data analysis from my time at [Paytm](https://paytm.com/about-us),           
where I worked with major clients such as INOX-PVR. I was responsible for analyzing customer behavior 
and purchasing patterns, providing actionable insights, and developing data-driven marketing strategies 
to optimize client engagement and growth.    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eed02ffa-b58f-41f7-a25a-8fe75e4df683" alt="Paytm Logo" width="30">
