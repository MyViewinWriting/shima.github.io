My research and professional interests revolve around understanding businesses, analyzing their data, and applying machine learning techniques to extract actionable insights. I hold a Master Degree in International Management from HSE University, Moscow & EDHEC Business School(Exchange sem-duration)

Professional Experiene
======
📚I have research experience as a Research Analyst at HSE University, where I contributed to crowdsourcing contests, analyzing the socio-economic profiles of participants. I have presented this work at Open and User Innovation Conference (OUI). This experience strengthened my understanding of data analysis 
and sparked my passion for uncovering patterns in complex datasets.

💻In addition to research, I have hands-on experience in business data analysis from my time at Paytm, 
where I worked with major clients such as INOX-PVR. I was responsible for analyzing customer behavior 
and purchasing patterns, providing actionable insights, and developing data-driven marketing strategies 
to optimize client engagement and growth.
