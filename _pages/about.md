My research and professional interests revolve around understanding businesses, analyzing their data, and applying machine learning techniques to extract actionable insights. 
📚I have research experience as a Research Analyst at HSE University, where I contributed to crowdsourcing contests, analyzing the socio-economic profiles of participants. This experience strengthened my understanding of data analysis and sparked my passion for uncovering patterns in complex datasets.

💻In addition to research, I have hands-on experience in business data analysis from my time at Paytm, where I worked with major clients such as INOX-PVR. I was responsible for analyzing customer behavior and purchasing patterns, providing actionable insights, and developing data-driven marketing strategies to optimize client engagement and growth.
